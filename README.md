# Deep-neural-network-to-recognize-hand-written-digits-using-tensor-flow

Built deep  neural networks to recognize hand written digits using tensor flow.

to install  tensorflow use the command "pip install tensorflow"

'testimage.png' is the file, currently we are using for hand written digit recognition

you can keep any hand written image (28*28 size only) as testimage.png name in the directory where sec.py located to check.

NOTE: Use only 28*28 images
